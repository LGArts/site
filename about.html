Painting and sculpting are ways to create visual text.

I consider myself a process artist. My work leans toward the abstract. Although I begin my work with something in mind, I am open to exploration throughout the development of my art. The plan will often change in response to opportunities that arise during the creative process.

I frequently shift between mediums. For me, painting is a vigorous practice. Currently, I am working primarily in layers of oil washes over plaster. It is a medium which allows for exploration and I am continuing to expand and develop how I use this method. If I am feeling like everything needs to slow down I will spend some time working in clay.

My subjects most often are inspired by organics; where I spend time looking at things under a microscope or gather inspiration from the ocean, pieces of shell and other found materials. I am keenly interested in counterbalances; in nature, in people, in relationships.

Joining the studios of ARTHOUSE, Sacramento, California in January 2019, I also maintain a studio on the North Coast of California where I continue to find new inspiration.
